Dashboard notes — Power BI / Tableau

Purpose:
- Quick, recruiter-friendly visuals to show impact of discounting, top products, and region performance.

Suggested pages:
- Overview: KPI cards (Total Sales, Total Profit, Profit Margin), month-over-month trend.
- Region & Category: map or bar charts for Sales and Profit by Region and State, filter by Category.
- Discount Impact: scatter plot (discount vs profit) with size = sales, color = category.
- Customers: table of top customers by profit and an orders-per-customer chart.

Data sources:
- Use `data/processed/superstore_cleaned.csv` as the single source of truth for visuals.

Tips:
- Keep visuals simple — recruiters and hiring managers prefer clarity over flashy design.
- Add short notes on each page explaining the business implication (1–2 lines).
