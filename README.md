## Quick start (PowerShell)

1) Create a Python environment and install requirements:

```powershell
python -m venv .venv; .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2) Place the original `Superstore.csv` in `data/raw/`.

3) Run the cleaning script to produce `data/processed/superstore_cleaned.csv`:

```powershell
python scripts\clean_data.py --input "data/raw/Superstore.csv" --output "data/processed/superstore_cleaned.csv"
```

4) Load the cleaned CSV into your RDBMS of choice (Postgres/MySQL/SQLite) or run the SQL files directly against a local SQLite DB after importing the CSV.

## Recommended workflow

1. Clean and standardize data using `scripts/clean_data.py`.
2. Load the cleaned CSV into a database (or use pandas / DuckDB for analysis).
3. Run the SQL scripts in `sql/` in order (01 → 07) to reproduce the analysis.
4. Use `reports/executive_summary.md` for the top-level talking points for interviews or the hiring manager.
